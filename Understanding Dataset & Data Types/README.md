# Understanding Dataset & Data Types

## Aim
The aim of this task is to understand the structure of a real-world dataset understanding dataset and identifying different types of data used in machine learning such as numerical, categorical, binary, and ordinal data.

## Dataset Used
**Titanic Dataset**

The Titanic dataset contains information about 891 passengers with 12 attributes. Each record represents one passenger, and each column describes a specific passenger characteristic.

## Files in This Folder
- **Titanic-Dataset.csv** – Raw dataset used for analysis
- **Titanic_Notebook.ipynb** – Jupyter Notebook containing dataset exploration code
- **Titanic_Dataset_Analysis_Report.pdf** – Report summarizing dataset analysis and observations

---

## Data Types Identified
- **Numerical:** Age, Fare, SibSp, Parch  
- **Categorical:** Sex, Ticket, Cabin, Embarked, Name  
- **Binary:** Survived  
- **Ordinal:** Pclass  

---

## Key Observations
- The dataset contains missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked columns  
- Average passenger age is around 29 years  
- Fare values show high variation and presence of outliers  
- Survival rate is approximately 38%

## Tools & Technologies Used
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas

---

## Learning Outcome
This task helped in understanding dataset understanding and recognizing different data types before performing data preprocessing and model building.
