# Data Cleaning & Missing Value Handling

## Aim
The aim of this task is to perform data cleaning and handle missing values in a real-world dataset to make it suitable for data analysis and machine learning.

---

## Dataset Used
**House Prices Dataset**

This dataset contains information related to house properties and their prices. It includes numerical and categorical features that require cleaning before further processing.

---

## Files in This Folder
- **house_prices.csv** – Original raw dataset
- **House_Prices_Cleaned.csv** – Cleaned dataset after handling missing values
- **HousePrices_Data_Cleaning.ipynb** – Jupyter Notebook containing data cleaning steps

---

## Data Cleaning Steps Performed
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas
- Identified missing values using `isnull()` and `info()`
- Handled missing numerical values using mean/median imputation
- Handled missing categorical values using mode or appropriate replacement
- Removed or corrected inconsistent data
- Verified cleaned dataset structure
- Saved the cleaned dataset for future use

---

## Key Observations
- Missing values were present in multiple columns
- Data cleaning improved dataset consistency
- Cleaned dataset is more suitable for analysis and model building

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy

---

## Learning Outcome
This task helped in understanding the importance of data cleaning and how handling missing values improves data quality and model performance.

---

## Conclusion
Data cleaning is a critical step in the machine learning pipeline. Proper handling of missing values ensures reliable analysis and better prediction results.
