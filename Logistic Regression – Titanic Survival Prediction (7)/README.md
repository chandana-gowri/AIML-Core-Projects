# Titanic Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Aim
To build a Logistic Regression classification model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using demographic and travel-related features.

---

## Dataset Used
**Titanic Dataset**

The dataset contains passenger details such as age, gender, class, fare, and other attributes. The target variable is `Survived`.
