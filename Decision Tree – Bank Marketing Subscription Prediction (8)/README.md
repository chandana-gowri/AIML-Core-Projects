# Bank Marketing Prediction using Decision Tree

## Aim
To build a Decision Tree Classification model to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on bank marketing campaign data.

---

## Dataset Used
**Bank Marketing Dataset**

This dataset contains details of customers contacted during marketing campaigns such as age, job, marital status, balance, duration of call, and previous campaign outcomes. The target variable indicates whether the customer subscribed to the deposit.

---

## Files in This Folder
- **bank-full.csv** – Original dataset used for training and testing
- **Bank_Marketing_Decision_Tree.ipynb** – Jupyter Notebook containing Decision Tree implementation

---

## Steps Performed
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas
- Checked dataset structure and missing values
- Performed data preprocessing and feature selection
- Converted categorical features into numerical form using encoding
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- Trained a Decision Tree Classifier model
- Evaluated the model performance
- Visualized the Decision Tree structure

---

## Output
The Decision Tree visualization shows how the model splits data based on important features such as call duration and previous campaign outcome to classify whether the customer will subscribe or not.

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

---

## Learning Outcome
This task helped in understanding how Decision Tree classifiers work, how splitting conditions are selected, and how tree visualization helps in interpreting model decisions.

---

## Conclusion
The Decision Tree model successfully classified customer subscription outcomes using marketing campaign features. The tree structure provides clear decision rules and helps in understanding customer behavior patterns.
