# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Iris Dataset

## Aim
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset and gain insights using statistical methods and visualizations.

---

## Dataset Used
**Iris Dataset**

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset used for classification tasks. It contains measurements of iris flowers and their species.

---

## Files in This Folder
- **Iris.csv** – Original dataset
- **Iris_EDA_Notebook.ipynb** – Jupyter Notebook containing complete EDA code
- **Iris_Visual_Insights_Report.pdf** – Report summarizing key insights and visualization findings

---

## EDA Tasks Performed
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas
- Checked dataset shape and column details
- Verified missing values and data quality
- Performed statistical summary using `describe()`
- Visualized feature distributions using histograms
- Identified outliers using boxplots
- Performed correlation analysis using heatmap
- Analyzed feature relationships using scatter plots
- Observed class separation among Iris species

---

## Key Observations
- Petal length and petal width provide clear separation between species
- Sepal features show more overlap compared to petal features
- Mild outliers were mainly found in sepal width
- Strong correlation exists between petal length and petal width
- Dataset contains no missing values and is clean for ML use

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## Learning Outcome
This task helped in understanding how to analyze datasets visually, detect patterns, find correlations, and identify important features before applying machine learning algorithms.

---

## Conclusion
EDA on the Iris dataset shows that petal features are the most important for species classification. The dataset is clean and suitable for machine learning without heavy preprocessing.
